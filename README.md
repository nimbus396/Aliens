# Aliens
Aliens is a space invaders type of game written in JavaScript.

I wrote this game on a bet.  A friend told me Javascript wasn't really capable of running complex games.  We argued for a minute about constructs and I took the bet.  I like old school so, I settled on a space invader look alike.

This is written from scratch and if you change the images, the game will adjust automatically.  The offset is based on the alien image.
